-- What can we say about the association directionality between hens' movement and keel bone fractures (and body mass)--
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 experiments including in total:
437 unique hen (266 have all measures throughout the entire experiment)
4 Periods each of 2-7 days where we tracked focal hens 

The health measure (keel bone fractures assessed with radiographs) was always assessed on the day after the last tracking day of each period

----------- keel bone fractures score
- severity*: keel bone fracture (KBF) severity score assessed at Period* (1-4), continuous 0-100, with 100 beeing more severe fractures
- gap*: presence of a fracture gap (binary: present(1)/absent(0)) assessed at Period* (1-4), --- should we inlude it as a second factor? ---

----------- movement scores
- proptime_2_ZoneAVG*: proportion of time spent on Zone2 (litter floor) during the daytime, averaged over all days (between 2-7 days) of Period*
- proptime_5_ZoneAVG*: proportion of time spent on Zone5 (top tier of the aviary system) during the daytime, averaged over all days (between 2-7 days) of Period*
- VTDperhourAVG*: vertical travelled distance per hour, averaged over all days (between 2-7 days) of Period*

----------- covariates
- HenID: unique identifier per hen
- hybrid: hybrid of the hen
- Treatment: treatment of each hen, there was one treatment per experiment
- IsOFH: binary variable: was the animal hatched on farm or not (kind of nested in the Treatment, as it was the treatment of one of the experiment, but we know the value for the other experiement as well: always 0: did not hatched on farm)
- ExperimentID: id of the experiment (3 in total)
- DOAAVG*: day of age average over all days (between 2-7 days) of Period*
- time2eventAVG*: number of days previous to assessing keel one fractures, averaged over all days (between 2-7 days) of Period*
- PenID*: A total of 8 pens (all included in experiment 1 and 2, and only three included in experiment 3). In experiment 2, the treatment half of the hens changed pens throughout time. Two of our observations have two pens during the period (called: pen4-pen3 ; pen11-pen12), so if we were to use penID, I would suggest to remove those two observations
