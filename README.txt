Each analysis is grouped into a single folder and should contain their own README

the UTILS python file contain function used in several notebooks from different analysis

the config_origin python file contains all parameters that is used in any analysis, to ensure that we consistently use the barn management schedule (light, wintergarden, vaccinations etc), and so that we have a single place to change a parameter when needs be.
