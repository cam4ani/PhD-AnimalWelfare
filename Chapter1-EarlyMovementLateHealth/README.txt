These files are the main code of the paper "Intra-individual variation of hen movements is associated with later keel bone fractures in a commercial aviary" that includes all models specifications. 

The R script is name "Main_R_script_paper.R" and needs as input both csv files "df_MVT_4individuality.csv" and "df_MVT_4stat_BI.csv". The former csv is the initial daily movement data (and is used in the manuscript to quantify inter-individual differences in movements), while the later csv file has the predictability estimates and the number of days with no transitions during the first three days in the laying barn  scores needed for the bivariate models (and is used to evaluate association with later keel bone fractures severity and feather damages scores).
